# Info on the coding test for Go Nimbly

This app will take two inputs, the first an operation and the second an expression. It sends out this info to the Newton API and will return the calculated value of the inputs that you entered. There is an error message that will pop up if you enter information incorrectly. You dont need to use the examples but they are there to help. The only operators that work are `simplify`, `factor`, `derive`, and `integrate`. You must use an `x` as the variable. There is also a Jest test for the API call. Dont worry about extra spaces in the input fields because I have accounted for that problem.  

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information. There is one test that is made to check the API call to make sure we are getting what we expect. To run it make sure to run `npm test` in the root directory.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
